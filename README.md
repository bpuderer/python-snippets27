# python_module_qs
Short scripts demoing the basics of some modules from the standard library and from PyPi that I have found useful.

Be sure to check out Doug Hellmann's [Python Module of the Week](https://pymotw.com/2/) for an outstanding tour of the standard library.  He's the author of [The Python Standard Library By Example](https://doughellmann.com/blog/the-python-standard-library-by-example/) and I can't recommend his site enough.
